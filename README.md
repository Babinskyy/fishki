## Project Description

Fishki is an educational flashcard application that helps users quickly create and manage study materials. The application leverages LLMs (via API) to automatically generate flashcard suggestions from provided text, significantly reducing the time needed to create effective study materials.

Key features:
- AI-powered flashcard generation from pasted text
- Manual creation and management of flashcards
- Spaced repetition algorithm for effective learning
- User authentication and account management
- Personal flashcard collection management

Fishki aims to solve the main pain point of manual flashcard creation, which often discourages users from using the effective spaced repetition learning method.
